## Lab 16: Serverless Overview


My serverless tool is a Number fact finder. The user submits a number and a random fact about that number is displayed. Upon refresh, a new fact is populated. 

Testing: 
- Learning the API: 
I went through the api link and the docs to make sure I understand the ouputs and the format of the JSON object to get the data points I need. 

- File Connection: 
Make a file in my VS code that gets a simple print statment. I used hello world. I also utilized the test file called DATE to make sure everything was working. 

- Make Route and Objet: 
I utilized the Vercel function log to serve as my console log. I added print statments through out the main website handing porition of the code to troubleshoot what URL was being referenced. 
Then I would paste that output into my address bar. 

-Connect the dots: 
Since I have the file connecting and the link built out to reference the file the last piece of my testing was to test different numbers in the web address and make sure the facts are displayed.
